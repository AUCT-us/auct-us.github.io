# Toward the WIN-WIN-WIN of shrewd crowdliness

How do we ALL win? We win, after we overdose on the euphoria of democracy, bit bottom and ... when we FINALLY decide to get shrewder about the game.

Must the game make us stupider? Yes, if we superstitiously believe that democracy HAS TO result in better outomes than free markets ... the game will make us stupider.  The converse is true -- if we superstitiously believe that markets cannot fail, we also necessarily get stupider.

The world's a complicated place ... it just does not work to be cognitively fixed on pet ideas and simplistic slogans, ie Nietzche/Jung and Nietzchean/Jungian simpletons who advocate just following a few simple rules will lead prideful humans straight into HELL.

The's more complicated than you can imagine ... if you want to get to WIN-WIN-WIN solutions, you need to be SHREWD about understanding trade, markets and tendencies of crowds ... and you will NOT always be right -- when you think you are, that's a sure sign that you are already *literally* wrong as HELL.

If you think you can master the game, you will necessarily get stupider. WIN-WIN-WIN is about understanding why you always want a couple other billion people to be getting ahead faster than you are ... AND you always want to be paying attention to what's working, what's not.

The world's a GLORIOUSLY complicated place ... you might not realize it yet, but ***you actually really WANT the world to be way more complicated that some simple illusion that makes your simple mind comfortable.***
