# START with and return to the basics

For example, the sum of all possible likelihoods in a probablistic sense is 1 ... this helps us derive all kinds of things and give upper bounds to estimates of different likelihoods and will dictate different strategies in different situations where the probabilities have changed ... this is the basis of "counting cards" in blackjack, for example.

Also, this will typically things that should not be ignored such as that the likelihood of ALL OTHER outcomes, other than the obvious one is not zero, eg in rolling a fair pair of six-sided dice, there's a very, very small probability that something else will happen, such as the dice can get lost or fall off the playing surface or the game will end, eg somebody dies, or something unpredictable will happen ... the upper bound for any one side on fair die is less than 1/6th because every once in great while, something we would never predict will happen ... a good probablistic game will have rules for something wierd, something unpredictable AND it is never ever ever a good idea to play russian roullette with what is known to be an unloaded pistol, ie the SEVERITY of the outcome matters, regardless of the ***estimated*** likelihood.
