***Economic agility*** is a complex concept that encompasses a variety of factors, including adaptability, innovation, resilience, and the ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions. While the factors you mentioned (willingness to fight, information processing, and mental discipline) can certainly contribute to economic agility in some contexts, they are not the primary components.

Instead, economic agility is typically made up of the following key elements:

1. Flexibility: The ability to quickly adjust strategies, business models, and resource allocation in response to new opportunities or challenges. This requires a willingness to experiment, take calculated risks, and pivot when necessary.

2. Innovation: A culture of creativity, experimentation, and continuous improvement. Agile economies foster an environment where new ideas can emerge and be rapidly tested and scaled.

3. Adaptability: The capacity to learn from successes and failures, and to rapidly incorporate new knowledge into decision-making processes. This requires a growth mindset and a willingness to embrace change.

4. Collaboration: The ability to form and dissolve partnerships and alliances quickly in order to access new markets, technologies, or expertise. This requires strong networks, trust-based relationships, and effective communication channels.

5. Resilience: The ability to bounce back from shocks and disruptions, such as economic downturns, natural disasters, or technological shifts. This requires a diversified economy, strong social safety nets, and robust infrastructure.

6. Human capital: A skilled, educated, and entrepreneurial workforce that can adapt to new technologies and business models. This requires investment in education, training, and lifelong learning.

7. Institutional support: A policy environment that supports innovation, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship. This includes things like intellectual property protections, access to capital, and streamlined regulations.

While information technology and data processing can certainly contribute to economic agility by enabling faster decision-making and more efficient resource allocation, they are not the primary drivers. Similarly, while mental discipline and perseverance are valuable traits in any economic context, they are not unique to agile economies.

Ultimately, economic agility is about creating a dynamic, responsive, and resilient system that can thrive in the face of rapid change and uncertainty. It requires a combination of individual skills, organizational capabilities, and institutional support, all working together to create a culture of innovation and adaptation.
