# Automate your intell gathering for optimizing 86400 seconds/day

Spend time most of your time exercising and training, doing hands-on or concrete things that you are familiar with from your profession. In other words, always be thinking about the RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT ... what are those vital few high-value things that you can do today which will yield more resources so that you can more efficiently, more productively do higher value things tomorrow.

Of course, when you are successful enough so that you do not have to work for others, you will still need to work *probably a lot harder* at completing those hard things which are necessary or on the critical chain of your project management approach for your major projects, ventures and start-up ideas ... you can take small breaks, but you will find that you are happiest if you are always building bigger things for the future. 

*What are those * ***bigger things for the future*** *which will be worthy of your effort and attention?*

That depends entirely upon you of course but, in general, you will will want to work in the realm of intelligence gathering ... things that give you better situational awareness of your personal opportunities, weaknesses, strengths, and future threats. Now more than ever before in history, a person will want to develop a daily proficiency in efficient, intensely personalized intell gathering to get a better understanding of the world's new opportunities and constraints so that you can LOOK FORWARD to better allocate your limited amount of skilled, concrete, professional hands-on time. 

USE the information from traders with skin in the game in different markets, use AI and other technologies in practical manner so that you can recognize the hype and fear-mongering ... because of the more rapid sharing of data, analysis and all kinds of information, the world is probably going to change more rapidly in the next couple decades than it has in the decades since you have been born, so you have to think about how you will adapt to be more antifragile, less backward-looking. 

*How you gather better intell and become more forward looking is entirely up to you ... but realize that nobody is going to do this for you.* You can and should learn from others and imitate the best, but your needs will be and *should be* UNIQUE. ***Recognize that YOU have to come up with YOUR own unique plan.***

We all get by with a little help from our friends ... but many of us do not recognize how important it is to continually make new friends. When you stop making new friends, you start to accelerate the aging and death process ... it's important to find new friends that challenge your skills a bit ... eustress is good ... bad stress and decay is bad. Avoid shallow old friends ... especially friends that choose to live in the past. Find ways to deepen and enhance friendships without simply rehashing the past, find ways to find the kinds of person that you want to be; find ways to make new friends ... add intelligence to those new friend's lives and LISTEN to your new friends to add intelligence to your life.
