# Embrace freer, fairer, more open markets ... IMPROVE prediction markets

What if prediction markets were themselves based upon a collaborative, open source development community of auctioneers and political economists skilled enough in software development and secure dev ops administration to not only use, but OWN and extend their own prediction market platform.

*Why should we even care about improving markets?*

ANY kind of market can really never be free enough, fair enough or open enough ... but the best way to improve markets is to engage tech-savvy auctioneers who love the freedom of auction and free markets enough to work at making the participants more shrewd, practiced, experienced and aware of the hidden informatational cues that price movements deliver.

Opening up markets is a matter of involving and engaging more people ... it's about making the political decisionmaking game more fun, maybe less risky, maybe more participatory.

Making markets fairer is about taking away any and all of the intimidation factors ... driving out hate, but allowing for free expression.

Making markets freer is about actually where it gets a bit tough, because freedom is not exactly free ... because there are always going to be trade-offs ... freedom emerges from effort, discipline ... not just being creative and decisive, but also accountable for your choices with mininal resources, building those resources and parlaying your stack of resources into something and the level of effort and discipline you invest in your choices.

Let's brainstorm how we might go about this
# For STARTERS improving prediction markets has several already obvious strategies for improvement that should be implemented ASAP

* Improve the dashboard with the use of more historical data: Historical data can provide valuable insights into trends and patterns that can inform future predictions.

* Tidy up the data and recordkeeping architecture: Keeping clean and organized records can help ensure that the data used for predictions is accurate and reliable1.

* Simplify the forecasting and polling models: Starting with a simple model can help to understand the basic dynamics before moving on to more complex models.

* Engagement Pipeline Action Plan: Implementing a smart assistant engagement pipeline action planner to help to track progress and suggest ways to make adjustments as necessary, ie observability engineering is about *listening* more actively.

* Improve the polling and forecasting Tools: The use of forecasting tools can automate the process and improve accuracy.

* Incorporate more ‘What Ifs’ and Qualitative Historical Data: Considering different scenarios and incorporating qualitative data can provide a more holistic view of the situation.

* Consider Seasonality: Seasonal factors can significantly impact sales and should be taken into account in sales forecasting.

* Abandon Biases and Seek Out New Data Sets: To improve prediction, managers must abandon their biases and seek out new data sets for forecast models.

* Tap Local-Market Knowledge: Local market knowledge can provide valuable insights that may not be captured in broader data sets.

* Well-Defined Outcomes: For a prediction market to take off, the outcomes need to be sufficiently well-defined that contract settlement is not in dispute.

* Attract Widespread Interest: The prediction market should be general enough to attract widespread interest.

* Important Enough to Matter: The prediction market should be important enough to matter.

* Unusual Enough Not to Be Replicable by Trading in Existing Assets: The prediction market should be unusual enough not to be replicable by trading in existing assets.

* Engage the audience to brainstorm more strategies that could potentially improve the accuracy of prediction markets.
