# Regulatory complexity is worse than regular complexity

It's because government is not an unbiased arbitrator ... government, lobbying and all of the things that provide special favors to special interests is necessarily biased in favor of the powerful. 

The powerful are not only advantaged by wealth and resources, they got to be powerful because they are better at playing power games ... not because they provided genuine value to society, but because they managed to the narrative to make the public, investors and institutions believe that the powerful are the heros who should not only be rewarded, but should be entitled to define the system that will determine future rewards. 

These power games turn mostly on control of information ... to make propaganda seem like news ... and to make politics seem like popular movements to free the oppressed ... but since the powerful control the narrative and lead the parade, they are able to direct public relations and manipulate perceptions to keep the oppressed and downtrodden completely bamboozled and oppressed and downtrodden.

Regulation is complex, except that it is dead simple in terms of what drives it and that is all about politics, propaganda, false promises of protecting those who cannot protect themselves and the illusion of democratic choice.

Politics is indeed a COMPLEX game and the powerful are MUCH BETTER at playing twisting the complexities of the political game and carefully crafting the flow of information and using carpet-bombing waves of propaganda to perpetuate the false platitudes of democratic narcotia to keep the stupid addicted to the things that keep them STUPID.

It's not exactly the politics ... it's the tight control of information flow ... for that reason, prediction markets and other forms of information that easily trump things like pollsters and political pundits have been targeted for elimination.

# Political complexity is multiplicatively more complex

The powerful can, will, do find and hire better complexicators ... the powerful can always afford better lawyers, better tax/compliance advisors, better lobbyists and better sychophatic politicians ... and the powerful WILL always use every device they can to extend, enhance and elongate their power ... most of that power is the result of complexification, especially political complexification.

Stop pretending that politcal solutions do not benefit the powerful ... you do not need to help the powerful, they will hire people to help them do well enough for the powerful ... STOP HELPING the complexicators, STOP HELPING the powerful.
