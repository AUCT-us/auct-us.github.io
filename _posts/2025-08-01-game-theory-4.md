# If you want to be a lot better off, spend more time studying what drives your quality of life

For most of us that means focusing studying our own brain health, our own neurophysiology, our own physiology, our own immunometabolism and the biophysics and biochemistry that drive our immune response, physiology and neurophysiology ... it's not about studying diseases and getting a better pill for ailments ... it's about listening better, continuously, in constantly meditative state to our breath, our aches, pains and body responses ... in order to understand the Reality of Reality actually is, we spend more time focused studying the hard physical science by applying it directly in our own lifestyle, our own exercise, our kinesiology and our own efforts to rehab broken or formerly abused systems ... your quality of life is intensely personal and driven by your own personal decisions -- stop blaming others for stuff that you have fucked up; focus on what you can do about you -- avoid the soap bullshit of psychology and stop psychoanalyzing others.

Computers a tool in this ... of course, topics like computers, programming, AI and related topics themselves ARE indeed very interesting ... but we should remember that they are tools and, most importantly, we should remember exactly who the tool is intended to serve. Anyone who tells you that computing and systems like the Unix way of programming, the Linux kernel and device drivers, minimalist machine images running *inside* containers and the realm of AI and large lnaguage models is not interesting CLEARLY is not too familiar with how ***addictively*** interesting computation, programming and artificial intelligence is ... and all of that stuff is getting even more interesting, particularly as more and more and more people effectively converse with one another through machine interactions. But computation is not as important to quality of life as understanding life, biology, Nature ... and older cultures and bodies of knowledge, like traditional chinesee medicine or martial arts that are based entirely on understanding Nature.
