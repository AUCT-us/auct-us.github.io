# Why we pray that the Creator's will be done

Our Creator is a LIVING Creator, who designed a living Creation.

A LIVING Creation from a LIVING Creator means that Creation is not exactly over ... it's impossible to say for sure, but MAYBE Creation has been handed off to living things to evolve and exhibit the properties of EMERGENTISM which allow the full beauties of the morphology of Creation to flower. It does not matter, our most EARNEST prayer is that the will of the Creator be done.
