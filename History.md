History ... is partly about Anthropology and what we know about richness of cultures as well as why certain cultres failed or died out ... this is about former examples of indigenous peoples, maybe pirates, maybe traders but communities that favored independence and indiviual autonomy and might have experience or lessons learned that would be tangentially related to Sharing Economies, Voluntaryism, Social Choice and Distributed Governance.
